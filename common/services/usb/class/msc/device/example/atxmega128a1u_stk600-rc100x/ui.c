/**
 * \defgroup UI User Interface
 *
 * Human interface on STK600:
 * - Led 0 is on when USB line is in IDLE mode, and off in SUSPEND mode
 * - Led 1 blinks when USB host has checked and enabled MSC interface
 * - Led 2 is on during read operation
 * - Led 3 is on during write operation
 *
 * Setup for STK600:
 * - LEDS connector is connected to PORTE
 * - DataFlash should be connected:
 *   - PC4 to /CS pin on DataFlash connector
 *   - PC7 to SCK pin on DataFlash connector
 *   - PC6 to SO pin on DataFlash connector
 *   - PC5 to SI pin on DataFlash connector
 * - SWITCHES are connected to PORTF
