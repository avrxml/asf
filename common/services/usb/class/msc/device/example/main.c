 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example shows how to implement a USB Device Mass Storage
 * on Atmel MCU with USB module.
 *
 * \section startup Startup
 * The example uses all memories available on the board and connects these to
 * USB Device Mass Storage stack. After loading firmware, connect the board
 * (EVKxx,Xplain,...) to the USB Host. When connected to a USB host system
 * this application allows to display all available memories as a
 * removable disks in the Unix/Mac/Windows operating systems.
 * \note
 * This example uses the native MSC driver on Unix/Mac/Windows OS, except for Win98.
 *
 * \copydoc UI
 *
 * \section example About example
 *
 * The example uses the following module groups:
 * - Basic modules:
 *   Startup, board, clock, interrupt, power management
 * - USB Device stack and MSC modules:
 *   <br>services/usb/
 *   <br>services/usb/udc/
 *   <br>services/usb/class/msc/
 * - Specific implementation:
 *    - main.c,
 *      <br>initializes clock
 *      <br>initializes interrupt
 *      <br>manages UI
 *    - specific implementation for each target "./examples/product_board/":
 *       - conf_foo.h   configuration of each module
 *       - ui.c        implement of user's interface (leds)
 *
 * <SUP>1</SUP> The memory data transfers are done outside USB interrupt routine.
 * This is done in the MSC process ("udi_msc_process_trans()") called by main loop.
