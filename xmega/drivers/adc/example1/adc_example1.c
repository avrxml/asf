 * \section intro Introduction
 * This simple example shows how to use the \ref adc_group for temperature
 * measurement with the internal sensor.
 *
 * \section files Main files:
 * - adc_example1.c: ADC driver example application
 * - conf_adc.h: configuration of the ADC driver
 *
 * \section apiinfo ADC driver API
 * The ADC driver API can be found \ref adc_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices with an ADC can be used.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * ADC A is configured for unsigned, 12-bit conversions using the internal 1 V
 * voltage reference. The conversions are configured for manual triggering.
 * Channel 0 of the ADC is configured for single-ended measurements from the
 * internal temperature sensor.
 *
 * An ADC interrupt callback function is used to handle the conversion results,
 * from which the current temperature, in kelvin, is computed. The computation
 * requires the factory calibration measurement, and is done according to the
 * following formula (T = temperature, R = ADC result):
 * \f[ T_\textnormal{now} = \frac{(R_\textnormal{now} \cdot
 * T_\textnormal{calibration})}{R_\textnormal{calibration}}
 * \f]
 *
 * The computed temperature is stored in the global variable
 * \ref last_temperature, which can, e.g., be watched during debugging.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
