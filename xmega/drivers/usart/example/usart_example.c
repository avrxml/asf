 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use XMEGA USART module.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 * - usart_example.c: the example application.
 * - conf_board.h: board configuration
 * - conf_usart_example.h: configuration of the example
 *
 * \section usart_apiinfo drivers/usart API
 * The USART driver API can be found \ref usart_group "here".
 *
 * \section deviceinfo Device Info
 * All AVR XMEGA devices can be used.
 * This example has been tested with the following setup:
 *   - STK600 
 *     USARTC0 should be connected to the RS232 spare port of STK600
 *       Note:
 *       XMEGA-A1 on STK600-RC100X
 *       XMEGA-A3, XMEGA-A3U and XMEGA-C3 on STK600-RC064X.
 *       XMEGA-A4U on STK600-RC044X
 *       XMEGA-E5 on STK600-RC032X
 *   - Xplain evaluation kit
 *     USARTD0 on PORTD is used by default
 *     Change to USARTC0 to use the USB Virtual COM PORT of the Xplain
 *   - XMEGA A1 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTC0 on PORTC is used. It is located on the J4 header
 *   - XMEGA A3BU Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTC0, pin 2 and 3 on header J1 is utilized
 *   - XMEGA E5 Xplained evaluation kit
 *     USARTD0 on PORTD pin 6 and 7 is used (Connected to board controller)
 * UART configuration is 9600 baudrate, no parity, data 8 bit.
 *
 * \section exampledescription Description of the example
 * The example waits for a received character on the configured USART and
 * echoes the character back to the same USART.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
 *
